## 3.1. Fantasy Vital Assessment

*(What to do instead of checking blood pressure, pulse, etc.)*

**To check Life Force/Pulse:**
- "Let me feel their aetheric pulse." (To check magical energy flow)
- "Is their life-spark flickering, or does it burn steady?" (To assess overall vitality)
- "Feel for the heart's drum." (To check heartbeat)

**To check Respiration:**
- "Observe the breath of the spirit." (To check breathing with a mystical connotation)
- "How deep is their soul's inhale?" (To describe the depth of a patient's breath)

**To assess Magical Status:**
- "What color is their aura? Is it clouded by pain or corruption?" (Visual check of magical health/mental state)
- "I need to perform a diagnostic scrying to see what curse is affecting them." (For magical diagnosis)
- "Run a quick Detect Magic cantrip over the patient. What kind of spell is this?" (To identify magical presence)
- "Check for any Enchantment Signatures within their aura." (To detect lingering magical effects)
