# Chapter IV: Advancement & Accountability

This chapter outlines the system for member progression, compensation, and disciplinary actions within the Healing Order.

## 4.1. Of Wages and Worthiness

Within the Court of Healing, compensation is granted not by the hour, but by the hands you heal. Our pay is commission-based, earned through the care you provide in the field. The more lives you tend to, the greater your reward.

- This system is not to be exploited. Speed is no substitute for compassion.  
- You are still expected to provide proper bedside manner and immersive roleplay with every patient.  
- Skipping steps or rushing treatment to chase coin is a dishonor to the oath you swore.  
- Talking over your peers on the radio to snatch calls will not be tolerated. You are part of a team. Act like it.

## 4.2. Pathway to Mastery: Promotion Guidelines

The Healing Order values dedication, skill, and unwavering commitment to our sacred duty. Advancement through the ranks is a testament to a healer's growth and mastery.

- **Rank Progression:** Apprentices ➡️ Essence Aide ➡️ Arcane Medic ➡️ Vitalist ➡️ Elder Healer ➡️ Healing Oracle  
  (Further advancements to Guardian Sage, Regent Sage, Arch Vital Affairs, and Grand Aegis are by invitation only, based on exceptional leadership and profound contributions to the Order.)

- **Service & Dedication: Hour Requirements:**  
  A minimum of 12 active service hours is required between each rank promotion.  
  These hours are logged in the time-chronicle and reviewed regularly.

- **Proficiency & Performance: Evaluation Criteria:**  
  - Skill in Practice  
  - Adherence to Protocols  
  - Teamwork & Communication  
  - Roleplay Quality  
  - Knowledge of the Codex

- **The Grand Review:** Promotions are not granted on a weekly basis. Instead, the Higher Ups will conduct a bi-weekly or monthly review of eligible candidates.  
  - During reviews, Higher Ups will consult time-chronicle for hours, misconduct-logs for strike status, and observe general performance in roleplay.  
  - Promotions will be announced in order-announcements or high-council-announcements.

## 4.3. Discipline & Redemption: The Strike System

The Court of Healing holds its members to the highest standards of conduct. With great responsibility comes accountability. Thus, a system of strikes exists to correct behavior, guide growth, and ensure the sanctity of our order remains intact.

- **Strike Expiration:** A single strike will automatically be removed from a healer's record after fourteen days (2 weeks) of good conduct, provided no further issues arise.

- **Trainee Policy:** Trainees are considered to be under trial and will face immediate termination for infractions.

- **Initiated EMT Policy:** For fully initiated EMTs, behavior that has not improved within two weeks will result in the strike remaining for an additional week. This continues until the matter is resolved or escalated.

- **Three Strikes:** Three active strikes shall result in termination from the order.

- **Warnings:** In some cases, management may issue a warning rather than a strike. This is a grace extended only once. Heed it well. If the matter addressed is not corrected, a strike will follow.

- **Duty Requirements:**  
  - Part-time members must provide a minimum of five hours per week.  
  - Full-time members must provide a minimum of eight hours per week.

- **Leave of Absence (LOA):** If you are unable to meet your expected hours, you must submit a Leave of Absence (LOA) through the proper channels. Attempting to file for an LOA after a violation in order to avoid receiving a strike will not be permitted.

- **Severe Misconduct:** Should you violate an SOP, a strike shall be issued. In cases of severe misconduct, you may also be blacklisted from EMS service. Some blacklists are temporary, lasting two weeks or more. Others are permanent, allowing for no return.
