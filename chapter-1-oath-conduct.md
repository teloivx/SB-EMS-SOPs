# Chapter I: The Healer's Oath & Conduct

This chapter outlines the fundamental ethical principles and behavioral expectations for all members of the Healing Order.

## 1.1. Pillars of Conduct

**Immersive Roleplay Is Required:**

- You are a healer, not a machine. Speak to your patients — no silent revivals.
- All care must be accompanied by immersive and respectful roleplay.
- Bedside manner is a sacred art. Be calm, clear, and compassionate.
- New to EMS? A starter script shall be provided to guide your early steps.
- Your goal is to grow into your own voice — with time, your RP should reflect your unique Sageborn path.

**Zero Tolerance for Sexual Harassment:**

- No jokes, gestures, comments, or physical RP of a sexual nature will be tolerated.
- EMS is a sanctuary. Violation of this law results in immediate termination.
- If someone makes you uncomfortable, speak up and report it.

**You Represent EMS On and Off Duty:**

- While wearing the crest, act with dignity and professionalism.
- When off duty, you are still seen. Your behavior reflects on the order.
- You need not roleplay as a medic at all times — but disrespect, trolling, or out-of-pocket actions will not be tolerated.

**EMS Sets the Tone for the City:**

- You are often the first face seen by new souls entering the realm.
- The culture of RP begins with you.
- You do not simply mend wounds. You shape experience and expectation.

**No Tolerance for Bigotry:**

- Racism, homophobia, transphobia, and all forms of hatred have no place here.
- You will be removed immediately. No debate. No return.

**Alignment with Server Rules:**

- These SOPs exist in harmony with the server's greater laws.
- Violating server rules while under EMS will lead to EMS consequences — and potentially server-wide sanctions.

## 1.2. Integrity of Supplies & Role

**EMS Corruption and Equipment Misuse:**

- Do not hand out, drop, or share medical supplies. This includes coworkers.
- If supplies are needed, members must retrieve them from their own bags or from the armory.
- Only EMS oversight or management may request you turn in your gear.
- You must be clocked in, in uniform, and on duty to provide any treatment.
- Off duty means no care, no gear, no exceptions. All tools must be stored before leaving service.
- Misuse of equipment or abusing your role will lead to punishment.

## 1.3. Professional Boundaries

**Refusing Care with Professionalism:**

- If a patient harasses or disrespects you, you may refuse care with grace.
- Always offer an alternative: another medic, hospital transport, or the check-in desk.
- Never ignore a call for help outright.
- In the field, you may hand off the patient to hospital staff and walk away.
- Do not abuse this protection. It is for safety, not pettiness.
