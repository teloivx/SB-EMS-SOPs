# ðŸ“œ The Healer's Codex: Standard Operating Procedures ðŸ“œ

*By Order of the Regent Sage*

To All Who Bear the Crest of Healing,

Let this tome serve as sacred guidance to those who have sworn their oaths to the Court of Healing. Within these pages lies the codex of our order, the ways in which we conduct ourselves, care for the wounded, and uphold the honor of our station.

Know this: the laws herein are binding and must be followed without exception. Every soul within the ranks of EMS is required to read, understand, and abide by the decrees laid forth below. To wear the crest of healing is to bear not only power but responsibility.

These laws are living and may change as the realmâ€™s needs shift. In such an event, word shall be delivered by command of EMS leadership or directive of the government. It is your duty to remain vigilant and informed.

Should you witness a breach of these sacred decrees or require intervention beyond your rank, you are to open a ticket within the EMS Discord. If for any reason you believe the EMS management team is not handling your concern with due seriousness or care, you are to escalate the matter by creating a ticket within the main city Discord. No voice shall go unheard â€” but you must speak.

Let it be known: corruption within our ranks shall not be met with mercy. Those who betray the sanctity of this order through deceit, neglect, or malicious intent will face immediate termination, formal banishment or blacklisting from service, and in grievous cases, permanent exile from the realm.

You are Sageborn. Hold fast to your purpose.
