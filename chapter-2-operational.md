# Chapter II: Operational Protocols

This chapter details the practical procedures for daily operations, including attire, communication, and scene management.

## 2.1. Uniform Standards of the Court of Healing

All who serve under the Crest of Healing are expected to present themselves with honor, discipline, and unity. Your uniform is more than fabric. It is a symbol of your oath and your station.

- You must wear the correct uniform for your rank at all times while on duty.  
- Once you have earned the title of Vital Affairs, you are granted the freedom to select any uniform color as a mark of your dedication and seniority.  
- No masks may be worn while on duty except for standard medical masks. The people must see the face of their healer, not a figure hidden behind disguise.  
- Present yourself with the dignity your role demands. The realm is always watching.

## 2.2. Aether-Comms & Radio Codes

Effective communication is the lifeblood of our operation. Utilize the following codes on your aether-comms (radio) for clarity and efficiency:

- **Code 0:** Beacon Unseen (Caller is no longer present)  
- **10-4:** By Your Word (Message received / Affirmative)  
- **10-18:** Returning to Ward (Returning to hospital)  
- **10-34:** Requesting Aid (Calling for additional units)  
- **10-97:** Marked the Course for [Location] (En route to the scene)  
- **Code 4:** Scene Secured / All is Steady (Scene is clear and safe)  
- **Code Blue:** Essence Fading (Flatline / Critical medical emergency)  
- **What's your 20?:** Where are you stationed? / Where are you located?

## 2.3. On the Field of Injury: Scene Procedures for the Sageborn

Upon arrival to a scene, you are expected to act with care and precision. Do not endanger others with a reckless approach or rushed entry. Move with purpose and awareness.

- **Triage Order:**  
  1. Those lying flat on their back  
  2. Those lying on their side  
  3. Those who are up and walking but still in need of aid

- **Patient Relocation:** Once a patient is found, relocate them to a safe and stable area before administering care.

- **Initial Assessment:** Use your third eye to assess their condition. This will reveal a vision that displays their injuries and ailments.

- **Healing Ritual:** Begin your healing ritual. Draw upon your tools and roleplay with intention.

- **Direct Care:**  
  - If bleeding, apply a Mending Wrap or Spider-Silk Binding.  
  - If no aetheric pulse, begin Life-Weaving compressions.

- **Patient Interaction:**  
  - You must speak to your patient.  
  - Silent revivals are not permitted.  
  - Every patient is owed the respect of bedside manner.  
  - Let your presence be felt. Let your voice be steady.
